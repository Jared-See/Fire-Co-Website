                      meeting  was  convened  to  call  the  company  back  to  active  duty  as  a  firefighting  unit  and  to  fill  the  offices  vacated  by  the  deaths  of  Mr.  Engle  and  Mr.  Clayton,  who  had  held  office  continuously  since  1892.    A  few  days  later  the  members  elected  a  complete  slate  of  permanent  officers.  The  new  president  was  James  O’Neil,  a  builder  and  house  mover  by  trade.  He  served  in  this  office  until  1930.  The  treasurer  was  Carl  Luckow,  who  served  until  his  death  in  1946.  The  secretary  was  Samuel  Johnston,  who  served  in  office  until  1939.  The  new  chief  was  J.  Harvey  Gottschalk,  owner  of  a  garage,  who  served  until  1924.  His  five  sons  later  served  Ogontz  Fire  Company  in  many  capacities.  The  members  of  the  rejuvenated  company  discovered  that  they  had  inherited  about  $1,000  from  the  original  members  and  decided  to  buy  their  first  motor  truck—a  right-hand  drive  simplex  chassis  mounted  with  an  American-LaFrance  pump.  This  truck  carried  two-50  gallon  tanks,  500  feet  of  hose  and  two  ladders.  The  active  crew  consisted  of  23  men.    Eugene  Hawlk  loaned  the  company  a  building  at  8036  Old  York  Road  for  meetings  and  social  events  beginning  in  September  of  1923.  The  truck  was  stored  in  the  township  garage.    First  Home—In  February  of  1925  the  company  moved  into  its  own  home  at  8100  Old  York  Road  on  land  leased  from  the  Reading  Company.  This  was  the  first  time  the  company  could  carry  out  all  its  operations  under  one  roof;  it  remained  the  company’s  home  for  the  next  28  years.  In  the  fall  of  1926  the  Ogontz  Fire  Company  put  an  American-LaFrance  pumper  at  a  cost  of  $6,300  into  service.  In  March  1929,  the  company  replaced  the  old  Simplex  with  another  American-LaFrance  truck  at  a  cost  of  $5,600.  This  truck  served  the  company  for  10  years.  William  N.  Gottschalk,  son  of  the  late  chief  J.  Harvey  Gottschalk,  served  as  chief  in  1932  and  again  in  1937.  Gottschalk  was  an  employee  of  the  Cheltenham  Township  Highway  Department  and  later  became  building  inspector  and  fire  marshal.  John  Norris  was  chief  in  1938.  Henry  Kammere  served  as  chief  from  1933  to  1935.  S.  Clarence  Johnston  was  chief  in  1936,  but  was  force  to  resign  to  attend  to  his  responsibilities  on  the  police  force.    In  1947,  William  H.  Adair,  Sr.,  became  president,  and  was  succeeded  by  James  Goodwin  a  year  later.  At  age  23,  John  Steinmetz  became  the  youngest  chief  of  Ogontz  Fire  Company,  a  position  he  retained  for  two  years.  Second  Home—During  this  time  the  members  began  to  draw  up  plans  for  a  new  building.  A  lot  at  Church  and  Old  York  Roads  was  procured  for  $6,500.  In  1952  final  plans  were  approved  and  ground  breaking  took  place  that  September.  In  March  1953,  the  building  that  had  been  home  to  Ogontz  Fire  Company  since  1925  was  sold  to  the  Fleck  Company.    
                      On  Saturday,  May  16,  1953,  a  formal  ceremony  and  parade  marked  the  official  opening  of  the  new  firehouse.  Township  commissioners  and  the  Hon.  William  F.  Dannehower,  Judge  of  the  court  of  common  pleas,  was  the  main  speaker.  Township  manager  Harold  C.  Pike  presented  President  Gottschalk  with  an  oversize  key  to  mark  the  occasion.  On  that  date,  the  company’s  Mack  “85”  pumper  truck  along  with  a  new  Mack  “75”  booster  truck  were  formally  housed  in  the  new  facility.Increasingly  sophisticated  equipment  was  added  during  the  1950,  including  self-contained  breathing  apparatus  and  foam  generating  nozzles.  In  1952  the  company  added  FM  radios.  They  helped  found  the  Montgomery  Fire  Communication  Association.  Many  of  their  innovations  remain  in  use  today.  By  1959  the  crew  realized  that  their  trucks  were  insufficient  to  carry  new  and  specialized  equipment.  The  company  purchased  a  GMC  truck  chassis  and  had  a  body  mounted  that  could  accommodate  additional  equipment  in  addition  to  personnel.  The  truck  was  called  a  “squad  truck”  and  proved  to  be  such  an  asset  that  other  fire  companies  in  the  region  copied  the  design.    On  April  14,  1960,  Samuel  Johnston,  whose  life  had  been  entwined  with  that  of  the  company  since  1910,  passed  away.  The  company  dedicated  a  plaque  on  the  front  of  the  firehouse  to  his  memory.  It  included  a  quotation  taken  from  Mr.  Johnston,  who  wrote  at  the  time  of  the  company’s  re-formation  “May  it  never  go  asleep  again.”Ogontz  took  a  major  step  forward  in  modernizing  its  equipment  in  the  ‘60s.  A  home  alert  system  was  installed  in  the  households  of  crewmembers  to  supplement  the  building’s  siren.  For  the  first  time,  diesel  powered  pumpers  were  ordered.  These  new  matching  Mack  C-95  engines  were  white  in  color—to  facilitate  visibility  in  traffic—and  introduced  the  image  depicting  our  namesake,  Native  American  Chief  Ogontz.  In  the  1970s,  Ogontz  augmented  its  mission,  becoming  Cheltenham  Township’s  fire  and  rescue  company.  To  meet  its  new  responsibilities,  a  1971  Mack  MB  chassis  with  Swab  walk-in  body  was  designed  as  a  heavy  rescue  truck,  replacing  the  1959  squad/rescue  vehicle.  Two  sets  of  Hurst  “jaws  of  life”  extrication  tools  were  carried  on  the  new  truck.  Since  that  time,  Ogontz  has  distinguished  itself  by  increasing  its  rescue  capabilities.  In  addition  to  extensive  training  in  fighting  fires,  today’s  crewmembers  are  certified  in  an  array  of  specialized  rescue  techniques,  including  high-angle  rescue,  confined  space  rescue,  water  rescue,  andice  rescues  in  addition  to  a  primary  emphasis  on  vehicle  rescues.    Current  Home—As  the  community  developed,  the  fire  company  began  a  search  for  a  more  efficient  base  of  operations.  In  1980,  Ogontz  dedicated  a  new  multi-bay  station  at  the  intersection  of  Old  York  Road  and  the  York  Road  Spur.  At  the  same  time,  new  twin  Mack  CF  1250  GPM  diesel  pumpers  replaced  the  1966  Mack  pumpers.  To  help  defray  costs  associated  with  the  new  facility  and  equipment,  the  fire  company  embarked  on  what  would  become  a  community  tradition  for  the  next  35  years—the  annual  Christmas  tree  sale.  The  fire  company  continued  to  grow  and  prosper  throughout  the  1980s,  ‘90s,  and  into  the  21st  Century.  The  company  saw  an  increase  in  membership  and  introduced  innovative  firefighting  and  rescue  equipment  under  the  leadership  of  Chief  Charlie  Farrington,  whose  record-breaking  tenure  lasted  from  1981  to  2007.    
                    A  significant  fire,  said  to  be  the  largest  ever  to  strike  “downtown  Ogontz”  began  on  the  evening  of  March  20,  1989.  The  Yorktown  Inn  was  reported  on  fire  at  5:39  p.m.  Firefighters  from  Ogontz,  Elkins  Park  and  LaMott  met  heavy  flames  upon  arrival,  and  summoned  assistance  from  surrounding  fire  companies.  While  the  flames  destroyed  the  100-year-old  building,  the  semi-attached  Yorktown  Mall  of  Shops  was  saved.  Firefighters  remained  on  duty  until  11:20  the  following  morning—a  record  total  of  17  hours,  41  minutes  on  scene.  A  mobile  air  compressor  unit,  enabling  on-site  refill  of  breathing  containers,  was  added  as  the  fourth  piece  of  fire  apparatus  in  1990.    On  April  16  1994,  at  a  house  fire  on  Twickenham  Road  in  Glenside,  Ogontz  firefighter  Ed  Knox  sustained  a  life-threatening  injury  and  was  rescued  by  fellow  firefighters  from  Edge  Hill  and  Ogontz  Fire  Companies.  Ogontz  colleagues  Rich  Echeverria,  John  Preston,  and  Mark  Salvatore  performed  first  aid  and  CPR.  Ed  survived  that  event  and  continued  to  serve  Ogontz  for  20  more  years.  He  celebrated  April  16th  as  his  “second  birthday”  for  the  rest  of  his  life.  The  21st  Century  has  significantly  increased  the  demands  placed  on  the  crewmembers  of  Ogontz  and  all  volunteer  fire  companies  across  the  country.  The  number  of  incidents  we  respond  to  has  increased  steadily,  even  as  the  number  of  people  willing  to  serve  the  volunteer  service  has  dropped.  From  an  average  of  170  calls  a  year  in  the  early  1990s,  we  now  average  more  than  400  call  per  year.  A  record-smashing  week  occurred  in  2012,  when  we  responded  to  more  than  50  events  within  a  four-day  period  following  Hurricane  Sandy.    Several  factors  contribute  to  our  increasing  workload,  including:  expanded  responsibilities  for  handling  non-fire  related  events  (for  example:  electrical  hazards,  dangerous  gases,  elevator  rescues,  floods,  downed  trees,  and  other  problems).  Increased  reliance  on  automatic  alarm  systems  raises  the  incidence  of  false  alarms  requiring  our  attention,  and  the  decline  in  numbers  of  volunteers  willing  to  take  on  these  responsibilities  means  we  are  frequently  called  to  events  outside  our  district.  Our  training  requirements  have  increased  due  to  the  sophisticated  equipment  and  techniques  we  now  use.  Additionally,  federal,  state  and  local  certification  programs  have  been  mandated  to  address  threats  of  the  kind  initiated  during  attacks  of  September  11,  2001  and  potential  threats  identified  since  then.  The  overall  impact  is  increased  demands  on  our  time  for  training  and  responding  to  emergencies,  yet  fewer  people  to  share  the  workload  with  us.  Nevertheless,  we,  the  members  of  Ogontz  Fire  Company,  remain  as  committed  today  as  we  and  our  predecessors  have  been  for  125  years  to  protecting  the  lives  and  property  of  the  people  of  Cheltenham  Township.  Our  service  is  an  awesome  responsibility,  a  high  honor,  and  a  privilege.  Indeed,  we  do  “face  the  past  with  pride  and  the  future  with  courage.”—Initially  prepared  by  Jack  Washington,  Sr.  with  help  from  Everett  S.  Hayes  and  Edward  Knox.
